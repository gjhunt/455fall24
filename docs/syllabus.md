Information for the course can be found on blackboard or on [github](https://gjhunt.github.io/455fall24)

## Lectures

Lectures are Tuesdays and Thursdays. I will post a .pdf of the lectures from each class. Attendance is not required. 

## Text

There is no required book for this course. The course material is broadly based upon the following two books. They are standard books in the field and highly suggested, but not required. 

1. Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshriani and Friedman: [https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)

This is an advanced undergraduate/masters level book. My lectures will follow along with these topics to a certain extent. This book is freely available online. I'll post relevant sections of this book one should consider reading. 

2. An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Applications in R by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani: [https://www.statlearning.com/](https://www.statlearning.com/)

This is a more undergraduate-friendly text. Again, this is freely available online.

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in person in my office at the place/times posted above. Additionally, I am happy to meet by appointment, send me an email.

## Datacamp Assignments (DCs)

We'll have programming assignments on [datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com). A free account can be signed up for (see the Blackboard announcement). In total, datacamp assignments will be worth 10% of the final grade. These assignments will be posted throughout the course and due a week after posted at 11:59 PM EST.

## Quiz Problems (QPs)

Approximately most weeks I will post a quiz problem (QP) that will be due the following week either Tues or Thurs at 11:59 PM EST. The quiz problem will be graded. In total, your grades on the quiz problems will account for 25% of your final grade. The QPs are intended to be completed alone so do not discuss them with your peers. 

QPs will be submitted on Blackboard under the appropriate assignment. No late submissions will be accepted for QPs. If they are not submitted on blackboard by 11:59 a zero will be entered for the grade. If there are extenuating circumstances and you cannot submit the problem, please let me know in advance ASAP. 

## Suggested Problems (SPs)

Additionally I will post a selection of suggested problems along with solutions (on blackboard). You are highly encouraged to do these problems as just doing just the one quiz problem will not be enough to prepare you for the midterm and final. 

## Midterms

There will one midterm in class during the normal lecture time. This midterm is at the date in the table above. The midterm will account for 25% of the grade. 

## Final

There will be a final written exam worth 25% of the grade at the date given above. 

## Final Project 

In addition, there will be a group project with presentations and writeup. The presentations will be during the last two lectures times of the course. The final project writeup will account for 10% of the final grade and the presentation to the class will account for 5% of the final grade.
